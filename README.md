# How to use?
As you use different types of desktop application e.g HeidiSQL, MYSQL Workbench, phpmyadmin etc that are directly installed on your PC. So i made an online application named Remote SQL editor.

To use this application simple open settings from menu bar and click on connect to db option. After this a form with some input fields are open. Just Type the Hostname/IP, Port(Or leave it as it is), DB Username and DB password then click connect. Boom you are now connected to your sql server.

Now if you want to apply some queries in your database just click on query option that is in the menu bar. Then a new page is opened. Now type queries and see the result.
