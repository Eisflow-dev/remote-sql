			<h2>How to use?</h2>
			<p>As you use different types of desktop application e.g HeidiSQL, MYSQL Workbench, phpmyadmin etc that are directly installed on your PC. So i made an online application named <span class="text-info">Remote SQL editor</span>.</p>
			<p>To use this application simple open settings from menu bar and click on connect to db option. After this a form with some input fields are open. Just Type the Hostname/IP, Port(Or leave it as it is), DB Username and DB password then click connect. Boom you are now connected to your sql server.</p>
			<p>Now if you want to apply some queries in your database just click on query option that is in the menu bar. Then a new page is opened. Now type queries and see the result.</p>
